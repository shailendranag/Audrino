# Audrino
I Created a calculator from Scratch in 2016 , Post passing out my degree. Using Audrino Uno board and lcd Screen 16x2 display. The Motivation behind this Idea came post, freecodecamp's Front-end challenge. Building From UI calculator to Real working Prototype. It can do basic operations addition , Subtraction , Divison and It Shows the input String Along with result, So As to Avoid Confusion. It's Has got bare minimum Validations, So definetly not a good one to keep on your desk for daily Stuff : ) .
